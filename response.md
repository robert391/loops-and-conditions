1. For the counter, I used a condition statement and did it until it reached a certain number. For the fibonacci numbers, it first sets the eax register to 0 and then another to 1. I then add. I swap the numbers between ebx and eax. I add and the sum is at the eax register. It will keep doing it until ecx is 0. For finding the biggest number in the array, it sets the biggest number to the first index of the array. Then it moves the address of the next elemment by 1. it compares with its biggest number. If it's smaller, it sets the largest number to value in its array.
2. Some challenges I encountered in this lab is the fibonacci numbers. I needed to see where tpo put a temporary variable when swapping. I decided to use the edx registyer as a temporary variable.
